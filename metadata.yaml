abstract: |
  Self-supervised learning (SSL) for video understanding, particularly architectures like Meta AI's Video
  Joint Embedding Predictive Architecture with Variance-Covariance Regularization (VJ-VCR), represents a
  significant advance in learning world models from unlabeled data. However, these models exhibit
  limitations in robustly handling predictive uncertainty, incorporating goal-conditioning, processing input
  based on saliency, and achieving strong zero-shot generalization. This paper introduces the Perceptual
  Emergence Layer for VJ-VCR (PELV-VCR), a novel conceptual framework originated by W. Kyle Million.
  PELV-VCR proposes to address these limitations by integrating computational modules whose designs are
  functionally inspired by specific efficiencies observed in human cognitive processes. These modules include:
  (1) a Saliency Masker, drawing from research on interest-based attentional prioritization in ADHD, to focus
  predictive computation on dynamically informative input regions; (2) a Meta-Contextual Intent Vector,
  inspired by the structure of targeting methodologies in remote viewing (RV) protocols, to enable
  goal-conditioned latent state prediction; (3) a Pattern Entangler, functionally analogous to enhanced pattern
  sensitivity sometimes observed in autism spectrum conditions, to detect anomalous statistical deviations
  within latent representations; and (4) a Counterfactual Synthesizer, employing probabilistic prediction
  techniques (e.g., Bayesian inference approximations via MC Dropout), to explicitly model uncertainty by
  generating multiple plausible future latent states. The synergistic integration of these components, as
  proposed herein, aims to foster the emergence of more robust, adaptable, and intentional latent representations.
  We detail the theoretical rationale, the proposed architecture, specific functional mechanisms, a composite
  loss formulation, and a rigorous plan for empirical validation using stochastic synthetic environments.
  PELV-VCR is presented as a conceptual contribution poised to advance SSL for video and the pursuit of more
  capable AI world models.
