\begin{abstract}
Self-supervised learning (SSL) for video understanding, particularly architectures like Meta AI's Video Joint Embedding Predictive Architecture with Variance-Covariance Regularization (VJ-VCR), represents a significant advance in learning world models from unlabeled data. However, these models exhibit limitations in robustly handling predictive uncertainty, incorporating goal-conditioning, processing input based on saliency, and achieving strong zero-shot generalization. This paper introduces the Perceptual Emergence Layer for VJ-VCR (PELV-VCR), a novel conceptual framework originated by W. Kyle Million. PELV-VCR proposes to address these limitations by integrating computational modules whose designs are functionally inspired by specific efficiencies observed in human cognitive processes. These modules include: (1) a Saliency Masker, drawing from research on interest-based attentional prioritization in ADHD, to focus predictive computation on dynamically informative input regions; (2) a Meta-Contextual Intent Vector, inspired by the structure of targeting methodologies in remote viewing (RV) protocols, to enable goal-conditioned latent state prediction; (3) a Pattern Entangler, functionally analogous to enhanced pattern sensitivity sometimes observed in autism spectrum conditions, to detect anomalous statistical deviations within latent representations; and (4) a Counterfactual Synthesizer, employing probabilistic prediction techniques (e.g., Bayesian inference approximations via MC Dropout), to explicitly model uncertainty by generating multiple plausible future latent states. The synergistic integration of these components, as proposed herein, aims to foster the emergence of more robust, adaptable, and intentional latent representations. We detail the theoretical rationale, the proposed architecture, specific functional mechanisms, a composite loss formulation, and a rigorous plan for empirical validation using stochastic synthetic environments. PELV-VCR is presented as a conceptual contribution poised to advance SSL for video and the pursuit of more capable AI world models.
